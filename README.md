Overview
This project explores the integration of an adaptive antenna array system with a spectrum analyzer and an Arduino for randomized beamforming and signal estimation. By generating and analyzing various antenna array patterns, this project demonstrates how to measure power levels at specific frequencies and estimate the signal direction based on received power data.

Features
Random Beamforming Pattern Generation: Generate and send randomized antenna array patterns based on specific angles.
Arduino Control: Utilize Arduino to control antenna array elements with the generated patterns.
Spectrum Analyzer Feedback: Measure power levels at a target frequency (5.5 GHz) using a spectrum analyzer.
Signal Direction Estimation: Implement an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm to estimate the direction of the signal.
Data Visualization: Visualize the estimated signal direction against the original angles
